## Testing

* This code has been tested to make sure that when the user inputs their name, they can only put in letters and when name is repeated is capitalised.
* The code has also been tested to make sure that it only accepts letters 'a, b, c, d'. If the user does not use those specific four letters, they get a chance to type again.
* The code had tested to make sure that it generates 5 random questions, without repeating the same questions.
* The code has been tested to make sure thst the user gets a chance to repeat the quiz.
